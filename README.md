TODO:  describe diagram with numbers and why

## Outline


1. Configure a Virtual Private Cloud ([VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-about)).
2. Create Virtual Server Instances (VSI).
3. Install web-app workload.
4. Configure High Availability and horizontal scalability.
5. Test application resilency.

## Configuration Procedure

1.  Create VPC (naming convention)
2.  Create address-ranges to make readability better.
3.  Change name of default network access control lists (NACLs).
4.  Rename default security group and change rules.
5.  Create DB security group and add rules. (TODO:  start lax and test, then tighten down)
